                <h3>Eye Health and Ayurveda</h3>
                <p>Our eyes, one of the 5 sense organs, play a major role in our lives, allowing us to see the beautiful world around us. To achieve optimal health, it is quintessential for us to ensure that our eyes remain healthy and that we prioritize eye care frequently. In modern times, we are exposed to the blue light from the television, computer screens, and mobile phones so frequently that our eyes are much more susceptible to stress than ever before. Not to mention, other factors such as dust, dirt, allergies, and communicable diseases never back down from being hazardous to them.</p>

                <p>As a result, we need to adhere to adequate preventive care which includes both early diagnosis and timely treatment under the supervision of certified eye experts. As a good measure, certified expert doctors specializing in eye treatments will often recommend you get your eyes examined every six months to reduce the risk of any serious hazard. Speaking of which, the ancient science of Ayurveda offers numerous means to achieving and maintaining healthy eyes. Through well-documented, tried and tested means of lubricating and revitalizing the optic nerves, Ayurveda aims to restore eye health and improve vision. Further ahead in this blog, we will understand how Ayurveda approaches eye health and explore some common Ayurvedic remedies to strengthen the eye.</p>

                <h4>Ayurveda and Eye Health - A Modern Outlook</h4>
                <p>Just like any other disease, Ayurveda considers imbalance in the tri-doshas to be the key reason for the development of a variety of eye conditions as well. An imbalance in Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas, the dominant forces in the human body as per Ayurveda, can lead to the development of a host of ailments such as eye strain, inflammation, irritation, dryness, and redness. These can, in turn, also adversely affect vision in the long term.</p>

                <p>This is where Ayurveda, the ancient science of health care, can come into play and help restore vitality, irrespective of age. An effective Ayurvedic treatment will aim at cooling, calming, revitalizing, and strengthening the optic nerves to restore eye health and vision. Ayurvedic treatments follow a holistic approach to healthcare which usually doesn’t only rely on medicines but also on dietary and lifestyle modifications, yoga, and meditation, to counterbalance the excess of any predominant dosha and restore equilibrium among the doshic states, and effectively eliminate ama (toxins) accumulating from the optic nerves while also supplying necessary nutrients to the root source through dietary regulations and Ayurvedic medicines.</p>

                <h4>What are some common eye problems?</h4>

                    <li>Adequate moisturization of the dry eye</li>
                    <li>Improvement in clarity of vision</li>
                    <li>Strengthening of the optic nerves through practices like ‘Tratak’</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>What are the common triggers of eye problems?</h4>
                <p>Some of the most common reasons for the development of eye conditions are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exposure to dirt, dust, and allergens</li>
                    <li>Overexposure to Ultra Violet Rays</li>
                    <li>Overexposure to blue light from computer screens, mobile phones, and television</li>
                    <li>Poor lifestyle habits such as consumption of alcohol and drugs</li>
                    <li>Ageing</li>
                    <li>Medical history of eye problems in the family genetics</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In case you have been a victim of the symptoms mentioned earlier, do not wait for too long. You may be on the verge of developing a certain eye condition. For effective eye care, reach out to a certified Ayurvedic eye expert at the earliest.</p>
