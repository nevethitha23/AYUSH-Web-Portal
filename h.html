                <h3>Understanding and Preventing Varicose Veins with Ayurveda</h3>
                <p>Varicose veins are becoming a common concern in India, with over 10 million cases every year. But that doesn’t mean they're not a serious disorder. To figure out ‘when to worry about varicose veins’, one must know the different varicose vein stages and their causes.</p>
                <p>They usually look like bulging bluish-purple twisted lines on the leg. According to some, they are just a cosmetic issue, but sometimes, they signify serious problems. If you want to know ‘how to prevent varicose veins’ naturally, then this article is for you.</p>

                <h4>What are the Causes of Varicose Veins?</h4>
                <p>If you have varicose veins, it means that there is something wrong with the valves in your veins that control blood flow. This results in blood pooling inside the veins, causing them to widen and twist, producing a knotted appearance. Although they can develop anywhere, varicose veins most often affect the legs and feet, which is majorly contributed by prolonged periods of standing or walking.</p>

                <h4>Symptoms Beyond Appearance:</h4>
                <p>Apart from the visible signs, there are other symptoms of varicose veins to watch out for, as they can indicate a more severe stage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tiredness and fatigue in the legs</li>
                    <li>Itchy and painful areas around these specific vein clusters</li>
                    <li>Swollen ankles and feet</li>
                    <li>Discolored skin surrounding the affected vessels</li>
                    <li>Leg ulcers (open sores) in severe cases</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>When to Worry About Varicose Veins?</h4>
                <p>Knowing when normal cosmetic issues start becoming medical problems is essential. Watch out for the below indicators to see a doctor as soon as possible:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Leg Pain:</strong> Persistent pain or swelling in the legs may indicate a serious vascular condition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skin Changes:</strong> Discolored skin or leg ulcers are advanced indications of vein disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hard or Warm Veins:</strong> Hard, swollen, or warm veins can indicate inflamed thrombophlebitis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bleeding Varicose Veins:</strong> If a small scratch causes profuse bleeding, it requires urgent treatment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Healing Sores or Ulcers:</strong> Chronic ulcers due to venous insufficiency need specialized medical attention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sudden Leg Swelling:</strong> Sudden swelling in one leg could indicate deep vein thrombosis (DVT).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Potential Complications of Varicose Veins</h4>
                <p>If left untreated, varicose veins can lead to complications such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ulcers:</strong> Sore wounds near enlarged vessels, especially at the ankle, caused by long-term fluid accumulation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blood Clots:</strong> Swollen legs can indicate blood clot formation, which requires immediate medical help.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bleeding:</strong> Veins close to the skin may burst, causing minor bleeding that needs assessment as it may recur.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Risk Factors</h4>
                <p>Several factors increase the chances of developing varicose veins:</p>
