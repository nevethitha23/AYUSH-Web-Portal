                <h3>Understanding and Treating Scalp Psoriasis with Ayurveda</h3>
                <p>In a world where 125 million people suffer from psoriasis, it becomes necessary to know the root cause of this disease and how to cure it permanently. Like any other skin disease, psoriasis can reach the scalp and create issues that impact your self-confidence.</p>

                <p>Scalp psoriasis is a persistent skin condition of the scalp characterized by red, flaky patches. Those who have it experience itching, pain, and discomfort and even feel ashamed of their appearance. This leaves the patient wondering ‘how to cure scalp psoriasis permanently,’ and the answer lies in our ancient system of medicine - Ayurveda!</p>

                <h4>Symptoms of Scalp Psoriasis:</h4>
                <p>Scalp psoriasis may range from mild to severe. Common symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red patches on the scalp: These patches can be pink or reddish on lighter skin tones or purple or brown on darker skin tones.</li>
                    <li>Silvery-white scales (plaques): Usually thickened but may be removed quite easily, causing bleeding at times.</li>
                    <li>Itchy scalp: It can be very irritating and uncomfortable at times, leading to itchiness that causes extreme discomfort.</li>
                    <li>Scalp dryness: The scalp feels tight and uncomfortable.</li>
                    <li>Burning or soreness: There may be a hot or tender feeling on the scalp sometimes.</li>
                    <li>Hair loss: A temporary hair loss can occur in some severe cases.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Psoriasis Treatment in Ayurveda</h4>
                <p>In Ayurveda, kitibha or ekakushtha are the names given to psoriasis, which is considered a type of kushta (skin disease). It happens because there is vitiation in Vata-Kapha dosha, leading to the accumulation of toxins (Ama) in the body. Poor eating habits, stress, unhealthy lifestyles, or inheritance might make this problem worse. ‘Psoriasis treatment in Ayurveda’ involves detoxification, dietary changes, herbal remedies, and lifestyle modifications.</p>

                <h4>The Root Causes of Psoriasis</h4>
                <p>Scalp psoriasis is mainly caused by an imbalance of Vata and Kapha doshas. It is characterized by scaly patches and dry scalp that are often accompanied by itching and discomfort due to being roughened, hardened (drying) by the wind (Vata), or moistened with Kapha.</p>

                <p>Ayurveda considers unhealthy lifestyle choices, poor nutrition, stress, and toxins as factors that intensify these imbalances, thus leading to skin infections like scalp psoriasis.</p>

                <h4>How To Cure Scalp Psoriasis Permanently with Ayurveda?</h4>
                <h5>Detoxification (Panchakarma)</h5>
                <p>Panchakarma is a fundamental part of treating psoriasis, according to Ayurveda. This process consists of various curative techniques designed to cleanse the body of toxins while also balancing out the Doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha). Some key Panchakarma therapies for scalp psoriasis include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vamana (Therapeutic Vomiting):</strong> This helps remove excess Kapha dosha and accumulated ama (toxins) from your system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Virechana (Purgation):</strong> It purges out heat from the liver and intestines by getting pitta dosha out through passing stool.</li>
                    <li><strong>Basti (Enema Therapy):</strong> This type of therapy removes vata dosha imbalance so as to detoxify the colon. The process involves inserting medicated liquid into the rectum to help you pass the stool smoothly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raktamokshana (Bloodletting):</strong> This technique eliminates harmful substances from the bloodstream, reducing inflammation. It usually involves precision methods to suck out the impure blood with the use of instruments or sometimes leeches.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Dietary Modifications (Ahara)</h5>
                <p>Now, if you’re wondering how to cure scalp psoriasis permanently while not getting into critical therapies, Ayurveda has simple ways, too! It focuses on the root cause of every disease, which is an unhealthy diet in most cases. Scalp psoriasis can be effectively managed with the help of personalized dietary interventions. Ayurveda advocates for a Sattvic diet that is light, easy to digest, and free from inflammatory foods. Some important dietary guidelines are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoidance of Trigger Foods:</strong> Do not eat spicy, salty, or sour food that increases pitta dosha in your system. Stay away from processed foods, white sugars, and deep-fried items that increase Kapha dosha.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inclusion of Fresh, Whole Foods:</strong> Eat fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes. Go for cooling fruits like cucumber, watermelon, and coconut water.</li>
                    <li><strong>Herbal Teas:</strong> Make herbal teas using neem leaves, turmeric powder, or tulsi leaves, which help reduce inflammation and purify blood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adequate Hydration:</strong> Drink a sufficient amount of water throughout the day to remove toxins from the body and remain hydrated.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Herbal Remedies (Aushadhi)</h5>
                <p>Some powerful anti-inflammatory herbs are present in Ayurveda that can be used to manage scalp psoriasis effectively. These encompass:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Azadirachta indica (Neem):</strong> It is characterized by potent antibacterial and antifungal properties. You can apply neem oil or paste on the scalp to alleviate redness and itchy feeling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curcuma longa (Turmeric):</strong> It is a natural anti-inflammatory agent. Rub a mixture of this herb with coconut oil onto your head or alternatively use turmeric with yogurt, once a week.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aloe Vera:</strong> Aloe vera gel calms down the scalp while eliminating redness and scaling. Apply pure aloe vera gel topically at the affected sites.</li>

                    <li><strong>Commiphora mukul (Guggulu):</strong> It is a popular anti-inflammatory and detoxifying herb. One can take it in tablet form under an Ayurvedic doctor’s recommendation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Lepa or Topical Applications</h5>
